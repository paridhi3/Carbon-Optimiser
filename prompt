Describe your lifestyle, and I'll estimate your carbon footprint.


My name is Paridhi. I eat red meat every day.

Your current estimated carbon footprint from eating beef 7 times a week is approximately 35 kg CO₂ per week—this is significantly higher than average, mostly due to beef's high emissions.

Suggestions to reduce your footprint:

Switch to renewable electricity sources at home, if available.
Reduce red meat, especially beef: even swapping a few meals per week for plant-based options (like lentils, beans, or vegetables) will meaningfully cut your emissions.
If you share details on your transport or energy usage, I can provide a more comprehensive carbon analysis and targeted suggestions.

what is my name?

To provide an accurate estimate of your carbon footprint, could you share more details about your weekly activities? For a full analysis, I generally need to know about:

Transport: How you usually get around (car, public transit, bike, etc.) and approximate distance traveled per week.
Home Energy: Which energy source you use at home (electricity, natural gas, etc.) and roughly how much energy you consume (in kWh or from your monthly bill).
Diet: What kind of diet you follow (e.g., vegetarian, mixed, mostly beef, mostly chicken, etc.) and estimate meals per week for each type.
If you're not sure about all items, even one or two details (for example, type of diet or main transportation method) will help me give targeted advice to reduce your carbon footprint and suggest practical alternatives. How would you like to proceed?

what type of food do i eat everyday?

No problem! If you’d like an estimate of your carbon footprint or ways to lower it, please provide a bit of information in any of these areas:

Your main mode of transportation (e.g., car, bus, bike, walk, etc.) and how far you travel each week.
Your home’s energy source (e.g., electricity, gas) and your approximate consumption or typical monthly bill.
Your diet (e.g., mostly plant-based, some meat, a lot of beef, etc.) and how many meals per week feature each type of food.
Even sharing just one detail (such as “I eat chicken 5 times a week” or “I drive 50 km by car weekly”) will allow me to calculate your impact and offer targeted ways to reduce it.

Would you like to focus on transport, energy, or diet? Let me know which area interests you, or just provide any info you have!

Tell me about your travel, energy, and diet habits...
