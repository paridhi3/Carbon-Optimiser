I drive an xuv to work everyday for 30km

You drive an XUV to work every day for 30 km. However, I noticed that the carbon calculator did not provide a valid estimated carbon footprint value. Let's clarify a couple of details:

Is the 30 km your daily one-way distance, or is it the round-trip total?
How many days per week do you commute?
Could you specify the model or fuel type (petrol, diesel, etc.) of your XUV for better accuracy?
With these details, I can recalculate your estimated weekly carbon footprint from commuting and suggest practical ways to reduce it. Let me know and I'll provide tailored recommendations!

it is one way distance. i commute 5 days a week. my car runs on petrol.

It looks like there was an issue with retrieving the estimated carbon footprint for your commute. Let’s clarify your situation:

You drive a petrol XUV 30 km one way, totaling 60 km per day, 5 days a week.
That’s 300 km of driving per week with a petrol car.
Generally, petrol cars emit about 0.192 kg CO₂ per km. For your commute:

300 km × 0.192 kg CO₂/km = 57.6 kg CO₂ per week (estimated)
Would you like suggestions on how to reduce the carbon footprint of your commute? For example, options like carpooling, switching to a more efficient vehicle, or using public transit can have a significant impact. Let me know your preferences, or if you’d like calculations for other lifestyle areas (energy use, diet, etc.).
